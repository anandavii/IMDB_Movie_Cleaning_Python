## Introduction

This repository documents the data cleaning process for the IMDB Movies dataset. The objective was to prepare the dataset for analysis by addressing issues such as missing values, inconsistent formatting, and incorrect data types.

## Dataset Source and Overview

The raw dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains comprehensive information about movies, including titles, genres, durations, release dates, and more. The initial dataset consisted of 85,855 rows and 22 columns.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this data cleaning project was to enhance the dataset's usability for analytical purposes. Specific goals included ensuring the accuracy and consistency of data types, addressing missing values, and standardizing formats across columns. This meticulous cleaning process aimed to prepare the dataset for advanced analysis and modeling, enabling robust insights into movie trends and characteristics.

## Insights Drawn from Data Cleaning Process

### Data Quality Assessment

The data cleaning process identified several data quality issues, including missing values, inconsistent formats across different columns, and incorrect data types. Addressing these issues improved the overall quality and integrity of the dataset.

### Data Consistency and Integrity

By standardizing formats, correcting data types, and handling missing values appropriately, the cleaning process ensured enhanced consistency and integrity of the dataset. This is crucial for reliable analysis and decision-making based on the data.

### Enhanced Analysis Readiness

Specific cleaning operations, such as splitting genres into separate columns and converting

## Tools Used

For the data cleaning project, the primary tools and libraries used were Python and Pandas. Python provided the framework for data manipulation and cleaning tasks, while Pandas facilitated efficient handling of datasets, including cleaning, transformation, and validation.

## Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process involved the following key steps:

1. **Data Understanding**: Thorough examination of the dataset structure and meaning of columns, including creating a data dictionary for reference.
   
2. **Data Exploration**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, anomalies, and specific cleaning requirements.
   
3. **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed missing values in columns based on contextual understanding and data analysis findings.
   
4. **Standardizing Formatting**: Applied transformations and normalization techniques to resolve inconsistent formatting issues in columns.
   
5. **Validation and Quality Checks**: Rigorous validation processes were implemented to ensure data accuracy and integrity post-cleaning.

For detailed information about each cleaning step, refer to the Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository.

## Output

The cleaned dataset resulted in 18,979 rows and 72 columns, ready for further analysis and modeling.

## Conclusion

The IMDB Movie Dataset cleaning project not only improved technical skills in data cleaning and manipulation but also provided valuable insights into real-world data challenges in movie analytics.
